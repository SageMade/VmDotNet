# VmDotNet
A Virtual Machine and compiler written in C# based on the B32 virtual machine (see [this tutorial](https://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/B32Machine2/VMCS.pdf]))

## TODO:
* Commenting pass
* Emulate multiple devices an interfaces (chipset)
* Better threading
* Better timing control
* State saving
* Possibly upgrade to 32 bit

## Licensing:
I really don't care if people use my code, it's not great. But I would like to keep in mind the fact that a lot of the core idea 
was taken from the tutorial mentioned above (written by [Alan Bryan](http://www.icemanind.com/)). I'm not exactly the best with
licensing and stuff so the gist of is it don't be an ass. I don't mind if  you use it, or modify it or whatever, but if you do use it,
some sort of credit would be nice!
